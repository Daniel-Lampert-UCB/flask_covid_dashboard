3943,"That's what society always depends on, experts and expertise. That's why I teach Shakespeare, Yeats, Bishop and Plath. I want my students to have an 'in' into what experts see as important and as being at the top of the various art forms. And I (try to) teach them why."
3944,"But if you are putting yourself forward as a Western expert then you had better have seen a huge amount of them, and (hopefully) have read widely on the subject.
Each genre has its own canon and I want experts in those genres to have seen the requisite films."
3945,"Now, this doesn't mean that if you haven't seen all of these films that you can't talk about films. Of course you can. I don't know everything about Westerns but I can still argue why Fort Apache is one of the best."
3946,"What reading Mr Cousins' books and articles, and watching his documentaries, I am being taught that the canon is limited, that it needs to be wider. And, crucially, he points me in the direction of those films that I should seek out."
3947,"Daughters of the Dust was cited as an example of a film that can be added to the list.
Added. Not replacing, just expanding.
There are many many more. That is why people like @markcousinsfilm are so important (at least to me)."
3948,"My view is very simple:
The canon is important.
If you want to call yourself an expert on film you should have seen a good chunk of these films.
But
For me the canon is not a closed list, it is a list that can grow and expand."
3949,"A thread about the film canon. There was a chat earlier about the canon in film and whether or not it was important for those who write about film to have seen any, some, most, or all of these films. Film history was seen as important to know about but not necessarily the canon."

5611,"@LouiseCrowley2 They're reviewing the LC at the moment, great opportunity to fix these issues."
5612,"So, when we talk about rote learning, about students not thinking for themselves, when we talk about changing the LC, maybe we should talk about alternative ways to get into college.
The points race dominates."
5613,"Why?
Because the Leaving Cert leads to college places.
This is a huge issue. Get it wrong for the students and they don't get into college.
That's all we want, to get it right for the students."
5614,"We, parents and teachers and thus students, are worried about THE EXAM, the Leaving Cert. This dominates and we don't want to make a mistake and ruin the students' chances of success.
So we fall back on what has been 'right' before and make them learn that."
5615,"Again this is partly down to moving from 15 to 18, not wanting to put their head above the parapet.
But we, as teachers, have to look to see how we have contributed to this. And so do parents."
5616,"Simply growing up counts for a lot here. They have been, carefully, shown that maybe their answer wasn't the right one, that they can be wrong.
But somewhere they start to be afraid to write down their own thoughts and ideas."

But she has a point.
Ss in 2nd year KNOW that they are right but by the time they get to 5th year they want soemone else to GIVE them the right answer. What changes?"
